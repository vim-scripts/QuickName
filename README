The most convenient way to navigate currently opened buffers.

Default hot key is F3.

Initially, QuickName display the full list of opened buffers in a compact way (multi-column) inside command area. As you type, QuickName narrows the list to only buffers with matched name. Hit <Enter> to open selected buffer. Hit <Esc> or hot key (default F3) again to close QuickName.

When QuickName is active, arrow keys and backspace function as expected.

Matching rule: thefile.vim can be matched with any of thefil, thefi.vim, thfl.vm. Guess why!

Should QuickName integrate with QuickBuf, and how?
